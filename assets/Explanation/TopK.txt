we’ll explain Top-K sampling, another parameter you can tune in our AI Playground Dashboard.”
________________


“Top-K controls how many possible words the AI is allowed to consider at each step.
* If K=1, the model always picks the single most likely next word → very deterministic.

* If K=50, the model picks from the 50 most likely words → more creativity.

Think of it like giving the AI a shortlist of words:
   * Small K = strict shortlist.

   * Large K = big shortlist.”

“Let’s try the same prompt: Write a sentence about the ocean.
      * With Top-K = 1, output might be: The ocean is vast and blue.

      * With Top-K = 50, output might be: The ocean whispers with rolling waves, carrying secrets across the horizon.

“So Top-K is about choice list size.
It’s a way to balance between safe answers and creative variety.
Try different values in our dashboard and watch how your outputs evolve!”
