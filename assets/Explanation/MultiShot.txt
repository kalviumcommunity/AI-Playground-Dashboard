“Hi! Now let’s look at Multi-Shot Prompting in the AI Playground Dashboard.”
________________


 “Multi-Shot Prompting means giving the AI multiple examples before asking the real question.
This helps the model pick up a stronger pattern, making its answers more consistent and reliable.
In our dashboard, when you choose Multi-Shot, we provide two or more sample Q&A pairs before the actual prompt.”


 “In the code, it looks like this:
if (mode === \"multi\") {
  finalPrompt = `Example 1: Q: What is 2+2? A: 4.
Example 2: Q: What is the capital of Japan? A: Tokyo.


Now, Q: ${userPrompt}`;
}


So the AI sees multiple examples, then your question.”
________________

System Prompt: ‘You are a helpful assistant.’
 User Prompt: ‘What is the capital of Germany?’
 Mode: Multi-Shot. [Click Send]
The model responds: ‘Berlin.’
 And notice — it followed the exact same Q&A style shown in the examples.”

 “So Multi-Shot is best when you want maximum consistency or want the AI to follow a specific format.
Compared to Zero-Shot and One-Shot, it’s more reliable when examples matter.”

Example Prompt for Multi-Shot
User Prompt in dashboard:
What is the capital of Germany?


Final Prompt sent to API:
Example 1: Q: What is 2+2? A: 4.
Example 2: Q: What is the capital of Japan? A: Tokyo.


Now, Q: What is the capital of Germany?


AI Response (expected):Berlin
