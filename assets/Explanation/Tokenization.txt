“Every LLM works with tokens, not raw words. Tokens are chunks of text — sometimes whole words, sometimes just parts of words.”
________________


* “Think of tokens like Lego blocks of language.

* Example: The word ‘unbelievable’ might be broken into 3 tokens: un, believe, able.

* Short words like cat can be just 1 token.

AI counts these tokens to measure input size and cost.”

   * “Here in our AI Playground, after every response, we log how many tokens were used.

   * Input prompt length and output response length both count.

   * You’ll see: Input: X, Output: Y, Total: Z (approx).”

“Tokens are the currency of AI models.
Understanding them helps you optimize prompts, reduce costs, and control responses.”
