Stop Sequences in LLMs
“Sometimes, you don’t want your AI to ramble on forever. That’s where Stop Sequences come in.”
________________


* “A Stop Sequence is like a brake signal.

* When the model generates a specific word or phrase, it immediately stops.

* Example: If you set END as a stop sequence, as soon as the model outputs END, it halts.”

   * “In our Playground, I’ll type a question and set END as the stop sequence.

   * Watch how the output immediately cuts off when it reaches that trigger.

   * You can also stack multiple stop sequences by separating them with commas.”

“Stop sequences give you control — they’re great for structured outputs, templates, or making sure the AI doesn’t overshoot.”
