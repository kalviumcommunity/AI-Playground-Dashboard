“Hi again! Now let’s look at One-Shot Prompting in the AI Playground Dashboard.”
 “One-Shot Prompting means giving the AI a single example before asking your actual question.
The example acts like a mini-training sample, showing the model the format or style we want in the answer.
In our dashboard, when you select One-Shot, we automatically prepend an example to your prompt.”
________________


 “In the code, if mode is set to one, we do this:
if (mode === \"one\") {
  finalPrompt = `Example: Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris.\n\nNow, Q: ${userPrompt}`;
}


So the model first sees an example Q&A, and then your actual question.”
________________

System Prompt: ‘You are a helpful assistant.’
 User Prompt: ‘What is the capital of Japan?’
 Mode: One-Shot.
The model answers: ‘Tokyo.’
 It followed the same Q&A style we showed in the example.”
________________


 “So One-Shot is useful when you want the AI to copy a certain style or format.
It’s a simple but powerful way to steer responses more reliably than Zero-Shot.”

 Example Prompt for One-Shot
User Prompt in dashboard:
What is the capital of Japan?


Final Prompt sent to API:
Example: Q: What is the capital of France? A: Paris.


Now, Q: What is the capital of Japan?


AI Response (expected):
Tokyo
